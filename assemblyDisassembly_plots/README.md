This script was written to plot the contributions of wave assembly and disassembly to the overall wave population. Briefly, an image of a population of waves - when labeled with some fluorescent marker - will have some average pixel value. The behavior of the waves over time can be tracked by plotting the mean intensity of images over time. If the waves get dimmer or go away, the mean intensity decrease, if the waves get brighter or more dense, the mean intensity increases. However, we can learn even more by analyzing how each individual pixel contributes to the overall image intensity. That is, _how_ are we increasing or decreasing the mean image intensity? To answer this question, this script calculates the rolling diffrence between frames and plots the sum of pixels that increased in value as well as the sum of pixels that decreased in value for each frame. In this way we can visualize the contriubtions of signal loss and gain - in different area of the image -to overall mean image intensity.

In the example below, I'm showing a kymograph from a frog cell going through its surface contraction waves. During SCWa, the mean intensity of the image decreases, while during SCWb, the mean intensity of the image increases. By visualizing the contributions of spatially separated signal loss and signal gain to the overall intensity. The plot shows that SCWa is associated with a continued increase in signal loss (F-actin disassembly) and a concurrent decrease in signal gain (F-actin assembly). Thus, the overall decrease in signal at this point in time is due to an accelerated loss of old signal and a decreased gain of new signal.
