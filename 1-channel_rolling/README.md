## Expected Output:

signalProcessing1C_rolling.py is written to batch analyze oscillatory dynamics _over time_ in both 1-channel time lapse datasets. The primary dependencies are numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-image, scipy, and matplotlib. See the environment.yml or requirements.txt file to create your own environment. 

An example ouput can be seen below:

In brief, the kymograph illustrates the excitable (in one dimension, oscillatory) dynamics found in the developing _X. laevis_ cell cortex. The plot below shows the raw ouput from this script, illustrating the changes in wave period and amplitude over time. 

Please check back soon for more details, I am currently in the process of updating this repository.
